# LodeJogger

Welcome to LodeJogger, an early experiment into making games in Pascal. 

This one was made in 1993, as I was transitioning from ZX Spectrum to PC and tried to get a hang of the game development process.

I thought [Plotting](https://github.com/stefandee/plotting) was my first game for PC. Turns out, as I was digging through archives, that this one precedes Plotting by roughly a year.

It's not finished (in fact, I would say it's not even started). It only exists as a reminder of early development struggles ;)

I had no graphics editor whatsoever back in the day and had no clue how to make graphics either. So here it's an early experiment of making graphics in ASCII then using GetImage to create a "sprite" out of it. After this experiment, me and my partner Alex figured out we badly need a pixel editor and, for Plotting, he created ZPED.

Memories :)

So, until next time:
